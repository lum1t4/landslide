# Landslide detection

## Introduction
This project is focused on the detection of landslides using satellite images. The main goal is to create a model that can predict the probability of a landslide in a given area. The model will be trained using a dataset of satellite images and the corresponding labels that indicate whether a landslide occurred in that area or not.

In particular, the produced model should achive a score greater than baseline on A19 dataset.
